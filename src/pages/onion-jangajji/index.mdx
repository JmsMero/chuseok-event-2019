> Jangajji or pickled vegetables is a type of banchan made by pickling vegetables. Unlike kimchi, jangajji is non-fermented vegetables, usually pickled in soy sauce, soybean paste, or chili paste. Jangajji dishes are usually preserved for a long period of time, and served with a drizzle of sesame oil. - from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangajji)
