Usually you eat a spoon of steamed rice first and have some vegetables from Yukgaejang or have a spoon of it. Many Korean people have a big bowl of hot Yukgaejang and put steamed rice in it and it becomes a simple "rice-in-a-soup" meal. The way we eat like that is called 국밥, which literally is translated as "soup-rice".

> Yukgaejang or spicy beef soup is a spicy, soup-like Korean dish made from shredded beef with scallions and other ingredients, which are simmered together for a long time. It is a variety of gomguk, or thick soup, which was formerly served in Korean royal court cuisine. - from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukgaejang)
