Soup on Korean meal table is not an entrée. Korean meal usually consists of the three things:

- 밥 (pronounced as /bob/, steamed rice)
- 반찬(/banchan/, side dishes)
- 국 or 찌개(/guk/ or /jjigae/, soup)

You're meant to have them altogether.

I'm not sure if this is a good comparison, but imagine baguettes when you have meal. You don't have a baguette itself. It goes together with other things. Likewise, you have a spoon of steamed rice and that's not it, but you also have another dishes or soup to help you swallow the rice.
